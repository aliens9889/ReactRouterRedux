# ReactRouterRedux

This is a project to learn more about React/Redux/ReduxForm/Route. I'm following a Stephen Grider tutorial.

This project will show you how to create, show and delete post using an api_key that Stephen borrow to us to learn more about it **About the Custom API_KEY you want to use, you can be creative but, don't mess around with childish stuff., PLEASE** 

The difference between the original tutorial and this one is that I'm going to use yarn instead npm (They are almost the same, but not, they don't xD)

So first you have to install the dependencies this way

> yarn install

To run the project you have to run this code
> yarn start
